    <ol>
        <li>
        <p><strong>User Experience Improvements</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Azure Security Center Push Integration (Preview):</strong>  The integration between Azure Security Center and Cloudneeti provides a seamless experience to customers in protecting their Azure environments against cyber-threats and mitigating compliance risks. Cloudneeti application will push custom recommendations with assessment data of Azure Cloud Account(s) to Microsoft Azure Security Center. Refer documentation for more details <a href='https://docs.cloudneeti.com/administratorGuide/azureASCPushIntegration/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Override security policy status</strong> : Cloudneeti allows admin users to override the security policy status. After an evaluation of a risk associated to policy compliance, Customers/Auditors can decide on overriding the policy to meet the internal governance needs. Various options to indicate 3rd
        party compensating controls, time-bound exceptions to exclude policies are available. Overriding policy status indicates that you have completed resolution and if done without caution, it might carry an inherent security risk. New resolution status will be effective at the cloud account level across all benchmarks post next successful Cloud account scan. Refer documentation for more details <a href='https://docs.cloudneeti.com/administratorGuide/overrideSecurityPolicyStatus/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Added support for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</strong>: Cloudneeti includes and extends Azure Security center recommendations for AKS by deploying a Cloudneeti agent to Azure Kubernetes Cluster. A docker container agent is deployed to collect data for additional security policies. Cloudneeti then provides out-of-box mappings for all 13+ compliance frameworks included in the product. Refer documentation for more details <a href='https://docs.cloudneeti.com/onboardingGuide/configureCloudneetiAgentInKubernetesCluster/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Security Policy Status:</strong> Added new policy statuses to provide more clarity to the security posture. This helps enterprise customers, MSPs and large risk auditors to conduct continuous security assurance using the Cloudneeti product. Refer documentation for more details <a href='https://docs.cloudneeti.com/gettingStarted/securityPolicies/#manual' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Manual – a security policy that is managed manually by the customer.</li>
        <li>Prerequisite – indicates that the policy needs actions by customers, e.g. configure permissions or deploy agents to collect meta-data.</li>
        <li>Excluded – indicates the policy was excluded as part of a policy governance actions.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Platform &amp; Stability Improvements</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Fixed following bugs </p>
        <ul>
        <li>'Windows 2012R2 - Ensure 'Restore files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'' not able to open details page.</li>
        <li>Getting 'No resources' even if 'Storage Contributor' role is assigned and storage accounts are also present.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Policies &amp; Benchmarks</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Added following 73 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) related policies</p>
