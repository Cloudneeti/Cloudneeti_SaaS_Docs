# **Release Notes**

## July 2019- v2.10.1

1.  User Experience Improvements
    *   Risk Dashboard: Cloudneeti introduces Risk dashboard based on “NIST Cyber Security Framework v1.1”. Last month we introduced our Industry leading Risk Posture (a matrix of machine learning infused Risk Likelihood prediction overlaid with Risk Impact). And this month we are topping that by combining it with a NIST CSF v1.1. A continuous risk assurance ensures a solid basis for justifying remediation plans, strategies and resource requests to management.
