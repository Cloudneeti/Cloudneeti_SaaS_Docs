May 2020 - v2.30.1 
-------------------------

1. **User Experience Improvements**

    - None

2. **Platform & Stability Improvements**

    -   **Microsoft Azure**

        -   Updated Azure Data collection and processing mechanisms to use Azure
            Resource Graph API to support massive scale requirements for following
            Azure Services.

            -   Virtual Machine

            -   Storage Account

            -   COSMOS DB

            -   MySQLDatabaseServer

    -   **Amazon Web Services**

        -   **New** AWS account onboarding using AWS config: AWS Account onboarding
            now supports AWS Config for bulk data collection from AWS accounts. This
            change allows customers with large number of cloud resources to be onboarded
            to Cloudneeti.

            **Details:** [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) enables you to
            assess, audit and evaluate configurations of your AWS resources. Using AWS
            Config APIs, Cloudneeti will now be able to pull out resource configuration
            metadata at scale. This optional onboarding configuration will be used by
            default for accounts with larger number of resources. Refer documentation
            for more details [here](../../onboardingGuide/awsEnableConfigBasedDataCollection/)

        -   Updated AWS Data collection and processing mechanisms to use AWS config to
            support massive scale requirements for the following AWS services.

            -   AWS::EC2::Instance

            -   AWS::EC2::Volume

            -   AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup

            -   AWS::S3::Bucket

    -   **Fixed following bugs**

        -   AWS k8s benchmark 'CIS K8s v1.5.0' has benchmark logo missing

        -   Duplicate resources are visible on policy details for 'Ensure that Windows Virtual -  Machines are always AD Domain joined'

        -   'Enable audit data recording' policy for M365 is marked as Manual even if it is Prerequisite and steps for prereq are also missing in specification

3. **Updates to Security Policies & Benchmarks**

April 2020 - v2.29.1
---------------------------

1. **User Experience Improvements**

    -   **New Cloudneeti API:** Added API to get a benchmark list for a cloud
        account. This API will be useful to get a list of all benchmarks supported
        for a given cloud account. Refer documentation for more
        details [here](../../userGuide/getSupportedBenchmarks/)
        

    -   **New Account onboarding health-status page (Preview) :** Added new page to
        display health status of an onboarded cloud account. For customers/partners
        managing large number of cloud accounts , the feature provides insights into
        the state of your cloud account onboarded to Cloudneeti like missing
        permissions, pre-requisites, etc. Refer documentation for more
        details [here](../../administratorGuide/manageAccounts/#onboarding-health-status-preview)

    -   **Updates to AWS Remediation framework:** Releasing new version to AWS
        Remediation framework. Includes new sets of auto-remediation policies for
        AWS accounts. Existing customer deployments will need to upgraded to the
        newwe version of the AWS remediation framework. Refer documentation for more
        details [here](../../remediation/awsRemediation/)

    -   **New Security Policy Status:** Policies that are overridden using the
        policy governance features released in v2.28, will now be marked with status
        “Policy(O)”, indicating a Pass due to an Override. Refer documentation for
        more
        details [here](../../gettingStarted/howItWorks/#security-posture)

        -   Pass(O) – a security policy that is managed over-ride by the customer as
            Pass.

    -   **New Risk Status:** Cloudneeti provides various security policies that are
        to be governed manually, either due to no automation being available, or it
        might be a related to a process/procedure that can’t be automatically
        deduced. As deduction is not automatic, the risk likelihood calculations
        mark them as “Undetermined”. This is available on the “Risk” dashboard and
        “Cloud Security Best Practices”. Refer documentation for more
        details [here](../../gettingStarted/howItWorks/#risk-likelihood)

        -   Undetermined – security policies with status ‘No Resources’ or ‘Manual’
            or ‘Prerequisite’ or ‘Excluded’ are marked with this risk likelihood.

2.  **Platform & Stability Improvements**

    -   Fixed following bugs

        -   "Ensure that the --insecure-bind-address argument is not set" is
            duplicated In Benchmark category Kubernetes - API Server and Kubernetes
            - etcd respectively

        -   Getting 'No resources' even if 'Storage Account Key Operator Service'
            role is assigned and storage accounts are also present

        -   Duplicate manual policies are visible with status Manual and 'No
            resources' for private benchmark

3.  **Policies & Benchmarks Additions/Updates**  

    -   **Updated policy benchmark mappings for NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, ISO/IEC 27001 for AWS, Azure and Office 365 cloud accounts.**
    
    -   **Added support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)**:

**April 2020 - v2.28.1**
----------------------------------
1. **User Experience Improvements**

    -   **Azure Security Center Push Integration (Preview):**  The integration between Azure Security Center and Cloudneeti provides a seamless experience to customers in protecting their Azure environments against cyber-threats and mitigating compliance risks. Cloudneeti application will push custom recommendations with assessment data of Azure Cloud Account(s) to Microsoft Azure Security Center. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../administratorGuide/azureASCPushIntegration/){target=_blank}.

    -   **Override security policy status** : Cloudneeti allows admin users to override the security policy status. After an evaluation of a risk associated to policy compliance, Customers/Auditors can decide on overriding the policy to meet the internal governance needs. Various options to indicate 3rd
    party compensating controls, time-bound exceptions to exclude policies are available. Overriding policy status indicates that you have completed resolution and if done without caution, it might carry an inherent security risk. New resolution status will be effective at the cloud account level across all benchmarks post next successful Cloud account scan. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../administratorGuide/overrideSecurityPolicyStatus/){target=_blank}.

    -   **Added support for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Cloudneeti includes and extends Azure Security center recommendations for AKS by deploying a Cloudneeti agent to Azure Kubernetes Cluster. A docker container agent is deployed to collect data for additional security policies. Cloudneeti then provides out-of-box mappings for all 13+ compliance frameworks included in the product. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../onboardingGuide/configureCloudneetiAgentInAKS/){target=_blank}.

    -   **Security Policy Status:** Added new policy statuses to provide more clarity to the security posture. This helps enterprise customers, MSPs and large risk auditors to conduct continuous security assurance using the Cloudneeti product. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../gettingStarted/howItWorks/#security-posture){target=_blank}.

        -   Manual – a security policy that is managed manually by the customer.
        -   Prerequisite – indicates that the policy needs actions by customers, e.g. configure permissions or deploy agents to collect meta-data.
        -   Excluded – indicates the policy was excluded as part of a policy governance actions.
