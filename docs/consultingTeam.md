The consulting team supporting the onboarding will typically consist of:

*	**Program Manager** - responsible for planning and delivery.
*	**Cloud Architect** – supporting technical dialog 

Below is a high-level checklist of things to review before the actual onboarding begins.

1. Understand Customer’s Environment and select appropriate cloud accounts for the onboarding.

    * Do you have Azure Subscriptions (or environments) in a separate Azure Active Directory (AD) (where company’s users are)?
	* Is the Azure Subscription you want to onboard is associated with a production Azure AD (where users IDs are)?
    
2. Provide a demo of the Cloudneeti product
3. Provide a walkthrough of the product onboarding 
4. Allow the customer to receive appropriate permissions for onboarding
5. Explain pre-requisites for onboarding
