Cloudneeti license is a group of accounts. Multiple Cloudneeti licenses can be provided to customer under one contract. Each customerâ€™s cloud account is registered a Cloudneeti account. 

Deciding on using a single license or multiple licenses can be done based on the following considerations:

*	Data aggregation and reporting for cloud accounts will be aggregated at the License level
*	Each License has an ability to configure their own IT systems integrations (reporting destinations, ticketing assignments, audit report feed destinations etc)
*	Each License can choose their own set of compliance reporting packages. (e.g. BusinessUnit_1 might want PCI DSS, CIS while BusinessUnit_2 might want HIPAA, NIST CSF, ISO27001 etc)
*	Each License can enforce different baseline policies for their set of cloud accounts.
