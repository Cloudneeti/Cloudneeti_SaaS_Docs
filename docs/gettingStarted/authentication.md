# Authentication

Cloudneeti allows customers to bring in their identity providers for authentication purposes. For authorization, Cloudneeti allows customer license admins to invite and designate user access to Cloudneeti. 

Cloudneeti does not manage user passwords/credentials. Instead, the application integrates with the customer’s identity provider natively, allowing for SSO (Single Sign-On) with the customer’s Microsoft Azure AD, Office 365, and Microsoft accounts (Outlook, Hotmail, Live).
