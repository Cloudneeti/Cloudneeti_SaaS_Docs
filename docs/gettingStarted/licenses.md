# Cloudneeti Licenses and Accounts

A Cloudneeti license is a group of accounts. Multiple Cloudneeti licenses can be provided to the customer under one contract. Each customerâ€™s cloud account is registered with a Cloudneeti account.  

Consider the following when deciding between using a single license or multiple licenses: 

*   Data aggregation and reporting for cloud accounts will be aggregated at the license level 

*   Each license can be configured to integrate with separate IT systems (reporting destinations, ticketing systems, audit report feed        destinations, etc.) 

*   Each license can be configured to choose a combination of compliance reporting packages (for example, BusinessUnit_1 might want PCI       DSS, CIS, while BusinessUnit_2 might want HIPAA, NIST CSF, ISO27001) 

*   Each license can enforce different baseline policies for their set of cloud accounts.
