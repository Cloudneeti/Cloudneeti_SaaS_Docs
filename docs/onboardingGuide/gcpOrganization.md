1. **Enable APIs on all the GCP projects present within organization** To ingest data related to GCP services to the CSPM product, need to enable [APIs listed here](../../onboardingGuide/gcpAnnexure/#gcp-apis-used-by-cspm-to-ingest-the-data). In case required APIs are not enabled in GCP projects then CSPM will not be able to collect configuration data for respective services.

2. **Create a service account** requires a service account with below mentioned viewer roles for collecting the resource configuration data. Here, you need to first create a service account at project level. 

3. **Promote service account to organization level**  updating service account create with appropriate roles at organization level.

4. **Add GCP Organization** includes adding GCP project information to the respective Cloud Account and waiting until the first data collection is complete.

|-------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1     | Enable GCP APIs                               | GCP Admin    | GCP Console |
| 2     | Create a service account and assign roles     | GCP Admin    | GCP Console |
| 3     | Promote service account to organization level | GCP Admin    | GCP Console |
| 4     | Add GCP Organization                          | CSPM Admin   | CSPM Portal |

### STEP 1: Enable APIs on all the GCP projects present within organization

To ingest data related to GCP services to the CSPM product, you must enable
below APIs. In case required APIs are not enabled in GCP projects then CSPM will
not be able to collect configuration data for respective services.

To enable the APIs on GCP project follow below steps

1.  Login to GCP [Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/){target=_blank} and Open GCP Cloud
    shell

2.  Execute below command to enable APIs

        gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com storage-component.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com monitoring.googleapis.com bigquery.googleapis.com dns.googleapis.com cloudasset.googleapis.com serviceusage.googleapis.com

### STEP 2: Create a service account

GCP organization onboarding to the CSPM requires a service account with below
mentioned viewer roles for collecting the resource configuration data. Here, you
need to first create a service account at project level and then it needs to be
promoted to organization level.

Service account requires below roles on the GCP organization,

| Role                | Type     | Details                                                  |

| Organization Viewer | Built-In | Read only access to view an organization                 |
| Folder Viewer       | Built-In | Read only access to get a folder and list the folders    |
| Project Viewer      | Built-In | Read only access to resource metadata present in project |
| Cloud Asset Viewer  | Built-In | Read only access to cloud assets metadata                |

Follow below steps to create, promote and assign roles to the service account at
