# STEP 7: Configure OS baseline and Vulnerability Assessment Solution
**This step is optional.**

Enabling Auto Provisioning of Azure Security Center monitoring agent and connect VMs to OMS workspace allows Cloudneeti application to collect data of OS baselines security policies as available in CIS [listed here](../../onboardingGuide/azureVulnerability/#azure-os-baseline-policies). 

**Vulnerability Assessment Integrations**: Enabling deployment of a 3rd party partner vulnerability assessment solution using Azure Security Center allows Cloudneeti to collect all the VA findings reported by partner solutions and associate them to each of the cloud assets.‚Äù

### 7.1 Connect VMs to Azure Log Analytics workspace

Installing the Log Analytics VM extension for Windows and Linux allows Azure Monitor to collect data from your Azure VMs.

1. Navigate to **Log Analytics Workspaces**

2. Create or use existing log analytics workspace

    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/log_analytics_workspace.png#thumbnail)

3. Select Windows VMs for connecting the Log Analytics workspace

    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/workspace_vms.png#thumbnail)

4. Click **Connect** to add log analytics workspace

    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/workspace_vms_connect.png#thumbnail)

5. Enable Auto Provisioning of Azure Security Center monitoring agent.

### 7.2 Install vulnerability solution on VMs

Vulnerability assessment solutions that are integrated with Azure Security center are supported, with the initial Cloudneeti integrations for Qualys and Rapid7. Other VA integrations will be rolled out in future releases

Deploy a partner Vulnerability Assessment Solution solution on VMs

1. Navigate to **Compute & apps** in **Security Center** 

2. Choose recommendation 

    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/SelectRecommendation.png#thumbnail)

3. Install solution on selected VMs

    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/install_solution.png#thumbnail)

4. Add details for installing agent

    - Qualys

    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/AddDestails_Qualys.png#thumbnail)

    - Rapid7

     ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/install_solution_Rapid7.png#thumbnail)

4. Verify the extension status Qualys or Rapid7 agent should be **Provisioning succeeded**
    
    ![Azure vulnerability](.././images/vulnerability/extension_verification.png#thumbnail)
