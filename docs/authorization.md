Cloudneeti supports “administrator” and “reader” roles under a License and under Accounts. In other terms, Cloudneeti application user can be a License Administrator or License Reader, Account Administrator or Account Reader. 

Account Administrator and Reader have access only to information about specific cloud accounts (Azure subscriptions) onboarded to Cloudneeti application. License Administrator and Reader will have access to information about all Cloudneeti cloud accounts under those Licenses.
