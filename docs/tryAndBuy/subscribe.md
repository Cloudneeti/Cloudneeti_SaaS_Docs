Request a License
-----------------

Customers can request a free trial or a paid subscription License.

The customer’s primary point of contact (who will become the License Admin)
requests Cloudneeti to provision a License. In case you don’t have a point of
contact from Cloudneeti, please use the contact us form on Cloudneeti website.

[Contact Us](https://www.cloudneeti.com/contact_us){target=_blank}

Cloudneeti creates a new License with License term (duration), industry
compliance packages and other customer-specific License level configurations.

Cloudneeti provisions customers’ primary point of contact as a new License Admin
under this newly created License. The License Admin receives an email
notification about being added in the Cloudneeti application.

When customers procure Cloudneeti cloud service on Azure Marketplace, the
License and License Admin are created automatically.
