The product is designed grounds up using highly scalable three-tier architecture with web tier, serverless microservices tier and data and analytics tier with NoSQL database. Meta-data collection for AWS happens using serverless Lambda functions running within Cloudneeti\u2019s AWS account. Meta-data collection for Azure is part of microservices tier and runs within Cloudneeti\u2019s Azure subscription. The Cloudneeti application enables data security for all data types imported, stored and exported during data collection, data analysis, remediations, single sign on and integrations. Data protection, high-availability and resiliency is considered from the very outset. All traffic to and from Cloudneeti is always encrypted and access controlled. Cloudneeti uses TLS1.2 for data-in-transit encryption and AES 256-bit encryption for data at rest. Architecture includes Single Sign On with the customer\u2019s preferred ID provider. Data Flow The data flow diagram outlines the data exchange between the Cloudneeti application and external systems. Access Permissions Cloudneeti follows CSP guidelines for third-party SaaS application integrations. AWS: The Cloudneeti application uses AWS External ID for AWS to access the meta-data within a specific AWS account. The AWS External ID is assigned a Security Audit role with specific Role-based Access Control (RBAC) permissions for accessing the management plane. Cloud connector, located in Cloudneeti\u2019s AWS account, is communicating with the management plane using AWS Trusted ID credentials. Azure: The Cloudneeti application uses App Registration within Microsoft AD to access the meta-data within a specific Azure subscription. The App Registration is granted specific Role-based Access Control (RBAC) permissions for accessing the management plane. Cloud connector, located in Cloudneeti\u2019s Azure subscription, is communicating with the management plane using App Registration credentials. Office 365: The Cloudneeti application uses App Registration within Office 365 AD Tenant to access the meta-data. The App Registration is granted specific Role-based Access Control (RBAC) permissions for accessing the management plane. Cloud connector, located in Cloudneeti\u2019s Azure subscription, is communicating with the management plane using App Registration credentials. For the Office 365 agent to collect the data, the agent requires Office 365 admin user ID and password (MFA with App Password). Cloudneeti connects to the agent using separate secure ID and credentials. Configuration Metadata The Cloudneeti application collects cloud resource configurations metadata to compare them with cloud security best practices (security policies). The Cloudneeti application doesn\u2019t collect any application or user data from the respective CSPs. The table below provides a high-level overview of the metadata collected.

Various cloud service components and encryption schemes (e.g. key vaults, AES symmetric key algorithms, higher-level cipher suites) are used. All backed up data is stored encrypted, and RBAC permissions are applied to the recovery team. Data encryption in-transit : The TLS 1.2 encryption or higher is applied for encrypting data during transmission. Data Access The cloud account data are owned by the customer. Cloudneeti support team requires encryption keys with explicit permission from the customer to view the data. The following access control mechanisms are implemented: Customer lockbox : Lockbox is a feature that ensures the Cloudneeti support team cannot access customer data to perform a service operation without explicit approval from the customer. Data classification : A \u2018Restricted\u2019 data classification is applied to the metadata in the data store. Data access : The production support team has access to the management plane at the data store level. They won\u2019t have access to decrypt the configuration data unless a support request makes it necessary. Customers have to explicitly grant access to the support team to retrieve the data for a time-boxed period of time required for resolving a ticket. Access control : All access requests are managed through Privileged Identity Management (PIM). Access logging : The access transactions to application and data in the data store are stored and monitored in operation logs.

The customer activates the license during onboarding of the first cloud account. The time of License activation becomes the start date of the billing cycle for paid Cloudneeti users. Cloud Account The Cloud Account is a representation of AWS account, Azure subscription or Office 365 subscription within the Cloudneeti application. License Admin can create multiple Cloud Accounts under each License. Resources Resources are the cloud services subscribed to by the customer under respective Cloud Accounts. Microsoft Azure is also providing a resource group level of aggregation of individual resources. AWS is using tags as a method to aggregate individual resources. Onboarding Onboarding is the process of granting required permissions to the Cloudneeti application for data collection and registering a cloud account in Cloudneeti application. Microsoft Azure and Office 365 subscriptions associated with a single or multiple Azure Active Directory (AD) tenants can be onboarded to the same license within the Cloudneeti application. Meta-data Collection Meta-data collection is the process of collecting cloud workload configuration information from CSPs. Re-scan On demand triggered meta-data collection is called a scan or re-scan. Security Best Practice Security best practice is a recommended configuration of a cloud resource that enables maximum security of the cloud infrastructure. Security Policy Security policy term used in compliance domain is fully equivalent to \u201csecurity best practice\u201d term used in security domain. Compliance Control Security policies are mapped to compliance controls of different compliance frameworks. One compliance control can have one or multiple security policies mapped to it. Compliance Framework Compliance framework is referring to Cybersecurity Benchmarks, Laws and Regulations, and Industry Benchmarks. Compliance framework typically consists of controls grouped under control categories, and one or multiple security policies mapped to each compliance control.

Enforcement \u2013 Providing Remediation Guidance, enabling Auto-Remediations, Integrations with customer\u2019s IT systems to log Tickets, provide data feeds and send notifications. Licenses Use of Cloudneeti application starts when a customer subscribes to Cloudneeti SaaS product and is issued a License. One customer can have one or multiple Licenses. Multiple Licenses may be required when customer\u2019s business is a portfolio of different business units and security assurance should be segregated by business unit. With multiple Licenses, a customer can manage security and compliance for each business unit individually. Cloud Accounts Under a License, a customer can create one or multiple Cloud Accounts. Each Cloud Account serves as a representation of an AWS account, Azure or Office 365 subscription. \u201cOnboarding cloud accounts\u201d means integrating Cloudneeti application with the cloud service provider (CSP) for cloud infrastructure configurations metadata collection. Security posture analysis happens primarily at a Cloud Account level. User Roles The Cloudneeti application supports Admin (administrator) and Reader user roles. A License Admin role is assigned to the primary user of Cloudneeti application. License Admin has access to dashboards, views and reports and can configure the Cloudneeti application. A License Reader can only access dashboards, views and reports. Access Permissions License Admins and License Readers have access to all Cloud Accounts under a specific License or multiple Licenses. Account users are given selective access to specific Cloud Accounts under one or multiple Licenses. In the example below, License User has access to all Cloud Accounts under License 1. Account User has access to Cloud Account 2 under License 1 and Cloud Account 4 under License 2. Assets Inventory As part of meta-data collection, during each scan, the Cloudneeti application retrieves the Asset Inventory information for each Cloud Account and stores these configurations in the data store. Assets Inventory includes Cloud Connector (AWS, Azure, Office 365), Cloud Account, Resource Group for Azure and Tags for AWS, Resource Name and Resource Configurations (meta-data). Security Posture Resource Status: The Cloudneeti application compares these actual Resource configurations against cloud security best practices (security policies) and determines security policy status \u201cPass\u201d or \u201cFail\u201d at a Resource level. \u201cPass\u201d status means the Resource is compliant with the policy. \u201cFail\u201d status means the Resource is not compliant with the policy. Security Policy Status: Security Policy Status is determined based on the number of compliant resources. The policy is assigned a \u201cPass\u201d, \u201cPass(O)\u201d, \u201cWarn\u201d, \u201cFail\u201d, \"Prerequisite\", \"Manual\" or \u201cNo resources\u201d status based on Resource Status for relevant to this cloud policy resources: \u201cPass\u201d status is assigned when configurations of all resources have \u201cPass\u201d status. \u201cPass(O)\u201d status is assigned when user overrides the securty policy status. \u201cWarn\u201d status is assigned to a security policy when configurations of some resources have \u201cPass\u201d status and the other resources have \u201cFail\u201d status. \"Manual\" status is assigned to a security policy when automation is not available. User can override the policy status to Pass/NA/Fail. \u201cFail\u201d status is assigned to a security policy when all Resources have \u201cFail\u201d status. \u201cNo resources\u201d status is assigned to a security policy when onboarded cloud accounts don\u2019t have any relevant resources for this security policy. \"Prerequisite\" is a status assigned to a security policy, indicates that the Customer would need to take additional actions to setup permissions/roles/enablement of services on the respective cloud service provider (Azure, AWS, Office365 etc). \"Excluded\" status is assigned to a security policy when a security policy is excluded globally or at the cloud account level. Compliance Percentage: Compliance Percentage is an aggregated percentage of fully compliant security policies (all resources under this security policy are compliant). Security Posture is displayed in the Cloudneeti application as views. A view shows Categories and category level number of Polices Pass/Total. Under each Category, a list of Security Policies is displayed with Security Policy Status and number of Resources Pass/Total. % Compliance and Policy Compliance Trends are also available within the view. Compliance Posture Cloudneeti application supports out-of-the-box multiple compliance frameworks. Security policies are mapped to compliance controls for each compliance framework, one or more security policies per compliance control. Resource Status: The Cloudneeti application compares these actual Resource configurations against cloud security best practices (security policies) and determines security policy status \u201cPass\u201d or \u201cFail\u201d at a Resource level. \u201cPass\u201d status means the Resource is compliant with the policy. \u201cFail\u201d status means the Resource is not compliant with the policy. Security Policy Status: Security Policy Status is determined based on the number of compliant resources. The policy is assigned a \u201cPass\u201d (Pass + Pass(O)), \u201cWarn\u201d, \u201cFail\u201d, \"Prerequisite\", \"Manual\" or \u201cNo resources\u201d status based on Resource Status for relevant to this cloud policy resources. Compliance Percentage: Compliance % is an aggregated percentage of fully compliant security policies (all resources under this security policy are compliant). Fully complaint security policies includes status Pass and Pass(O). An aggregated Compliance % per Compliance Framework is displayed across multiple compliance frameworks in the compliance dashboard. It is calculated as a share of fully compliant cloud security policies out of the total number of security policies with data. Risk Posture Cloudneeti implemented risk-based prioritization matrix using the ISO 27005 standard. The risk matrix is created by automatically categorizing each security policy for risk impact and risk likelihood. Risk impact can be \u201cVery Low\u201d, \u201cLow\u201d, \u201cModerate\u201d, \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cCritical\u201d. Risk likelihood can be \u201cNot Likely\u201d, \u201cLow\u201d, \u201cModerate\u201d, \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cCertain\u201d. Risk impact is preset for each security policy. Risk likelihood is calculated each time based on multiple metrics using machine learning algorithms. Risk matrix has X-axis and Y-axis showing the number of security policies in each X / Y segment. Accordingly, Security Policies with high risk impact and high-risk likelihood constitute a set of Security Policies with severity \u201cHigh\u201d. Cloudneeti\u2019s risk impact and risk likelihood categorization is based the following inputs: Common reasons of security breaches over the last several years derived from publicly available information disclosed by businesses Prioritization of cloud security best practices provided by CSPs like Microsoft Azure, AWS, Office 365 etc. Inputs from Auditors and Risk Advisors across various project over the last few years Customer feedback on their experience with certain security controls. Cloudneeti is continuously optimizing its Machine Learning algorithms to deliver a high accuracy risk analytics. Risk Impact Risk Impact is often defined as the consequences, or effects of a certain risk event happening, as related to a Software Application or an Organization. The impact of risk events can be defined in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. These metrics are cost, schedule, reputation, quality, scope, health, safety, etc. The Risk Impact five-point scale is defined below. Risk Impact Objective: Cost Increase Objective: Time Increase Objective: Reputation Damage Critical >40% 20-40% Possibly rendering project useless High 20-40% 10-20% Unacceptable to sponsors & stakeholders Moderate 10-20% 10-20% Might require additional sponsor approvals Low <10% <5% Noticeable reduction in project quality Very Low insignificant insignificant Barely noticeable Note: Please consult with your Risk Advisor / Information Security team to review the Cloudneeti\u2019s assigned Risk Impact in the context of your application architecture. Risk Likelihood Risk Likelihood (or probability), is the possibility of a risk event occurring. It usually is expressed in either quantitative scare (e.g. probability of 10%) or a qualitative rating (e.g. Not Likely). The Risk Likelihood five-point scale is defined below. Risk Likelihood Definition Certain Highly likely to occur with a probability >90%. High Likely to occur with a probability of 60-90%. Moderate Possible to occur with a probability of 30-60%. Low Will most likely not occur. Probability to occur is 10 - 30%. Not Likely Highly unlikely to occur with a probability <10% Undetermined Security policies with status \u2018No Resources\u2019 or \u2018Manual\u2019 or \u2018Prerequisite\u2019 or \u2018Excluded\u2019 are marked with this risk likelihood.

Resources Resources (\u201c Resource \u201d) are the cloud services subscribed to by the customer under respective cloud accounts. Microsoft Azure is also providing a resource group (\u201c Resource Group \u201d) level of aggregation of individual resources. Cloudneeti application The Cloudneeti application is a multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) product hosted on Microsoft Azure. The product is leveraging AWS serverless functions for cloud workload configuration data collection from AWS cloud accounts. Cloudneeti portal The Cloudneeti portal is a user interface of the Cloudneeti application allowing users to navigate the product, access dashboards, views and reports and configure the product. License Cloudneeti creates for each customer one or multiple Cloudneeti License(s) (\u201c License \u201d) to grant access to the Cloudneeti application. The customer needs to activate each license to gain access to the application. The time of License activation becomes the start date of the billing cycle for paid Cloudneeti users. Cloud Accounts The Cloud Account (\u201c Cloud Account \u201d) is an Azure subscription or AWS account added in the Cloudneeti application under a License. License Admin can onboard multiple Cloud Accounts under each License. Onboarding a Cloud Account Onboarding a Cloud Account to the Cloudneeti application is the process of granting data collection rights to the Cloudneeti application. Multiple Azure subscriptions with a single or multiple Azure Active Directory (AD) tenants can be onboarded to the Cloudneeti application. Users Cloudneeti grants designated people from the customer\u2019s organization sign-in access to the Cloudneeti application as users (\u201c Users \u201d). Cloudneeti uses SSO (Single Sign On) with the customer\u2019s Microsoft Azure AD, Office 365, and Microsoft Accounts (Outlook, Hotmail, Live). Users can sign in with their corporate credentials (email ID and password). License Admin Cloudneeti assigns the License Admin (\u201c License Admin \u201d) role to one customer representative who will have administration rights to the respective License. License Admin has access to dashboards and reports for all Accounts under the License. License Admin can manage users (add / remove / configure) with the following roles: License Admin, Account Admin, License Reader and Account Reader roles. License Admin can manage configuration settings at the License or Account level. Account Admin The License Admin can assign the Account Admin (\u201c Account Admin \u201d) role to certain users who require access only to specific Accounts. The Account Admin can manage users only within the accounts they have access to. Account Admin can manage configurations available at an account level and doesn\u2019t have access to configurations done at a License level (such as external data feed or ticketing interactions). Reader Roles The License Reader (\u201c License Reader \u201d) and Account Reader (\u201c Account Reader \u201d) roles are assigned to users who require only access to dashboards and reports, but don\u2019t need to be involved in configuring the Cloudneeti application. Subscription Term Subscription term is the time period when data collection by Cloudneeti application is enabled. Subscription term is tracked at a License level. It starts from the time when the License is activated when the first Cloud Account is onboarded. Data Retention Term The Data retention term is the time period when users can still sign in after the Subscription Term ends, but data collection is disabled. Users will be able to see the data only from previous scans. The standard Data Retention Period is 30 days, but it can be set at the time of the License request. Scan The scan is the process where the Cloudneeti application collects cloud workload configuration data from CSPs. Security Policy Security policies are recommended configurations of cloud workloads that enable maximum security of the cloud environment. Security policies are also called cloud security best practices. Cloudneeti Application Single Sign On Cloudneeti application doesn\u2019t manage user ID and password information, rather it enables single sign on (SSO) with corporate identity management system. Cloudneeti currently supports Azure AD, Office 365 AD tenant and Microsoft accounts (such as outlook, live, and Hotmail). Users enter their corporate ID credentials to sign into the Cloudneeti application. Data Protection Cloudneeti customers retain control and ownership of their own data. The collected metadata about configurations of customer cloud accounts (Azure subscriptions) is well-protected within the Cloudneeti data store. The following information security policies are implemented by Cloudneeti: Data encryption at rest: The customer\u2019s data is always stored encrypted. Various cloud service components and encryption schemes (e.g. key vaults, AES symmetric key algorithms, higher-level cipher suites) are used. Data encryption in-transit : TLS 1.2 encryption or higher is applied for encrypting data during transmission. Data access : The production support team has access to the management plane at the data store level. They won\u2019t have access to decrypt the configuration data unless a support request makes it necessary. Customers have to explicitly grant access to the support team to retrieve the data for a time-boxed period of time required for resolving a ticket. Customer lockbox : Lockbox is a feature that ensures the Cloudneeti support team cannot access customer data to perform a service operation without explicit approval. Data classification : A data classification of \u2018Restricted\u2019 is applied to the data store. Audit logging : All access requests are monitored through Privileged Identity Management (PIM) as well as operational logs. Data erasure: Expiry/termination of a contract will result in automatic clean-up of all data collected. Data backup: All backed up data is stored encrypted, and RBAC permissions are applied for the recovery team. Data retention: Data retention for active contracts is set at the time of License provisioning. Typically, this will be 30 days.","title":"systemArchitecture"},{"location":"gettingStarted/systemArchitecture/#system-architecture","text":"","title":"System Architecture"},{"location":"gettingStarted/systemArchitecture/#terminology","text":"Cloud Service Provider Cloud Service Providers (CSP) are companies such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that offer cloud hosting on their cloud platforms.

Registering the Cloudneeti application includes registering the Cloudneeti application with Azure tenant, providing access to Microsoft Graph and granting admin consent to the Cloudneeti application. Granting access to the Azure subscription includes giving the Cloudneeti application reader access to the Azure subscription and collecting Subscription ID, Directory ID, Domain Name information. Grant access to Azure subscription additional roles (Optional) includes giving the Cloudneeti application access to the Azure subscription, assigning Azure custom role. Custom role with permission \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action\" for Azure Subscription level scope. The Cloudneeti application needs \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action\" action present in Website Contributor role in order to collect authentication and authorization configuration of Web/API/Mobile/Function Apps which is hosted on the App Service Plan. The current subscription Reader role given doesn't have sufficient permissions to collect web site configuration details. Custom role with permission \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action\" for Azure Subscription level scope. Cloudneeti needs \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action\" action present in Storage Account Contributor role in order to collect metadata configuration of blobs. The current subscription Reader role given doesn't have sufficient permissions to list blob keys. Grant access to key vaults (Optional) includes giving the Cloudneeti application special permission on desired key vaults to get policy data related to secrets. Advanced Security configurations (Optional) includes adding a script to the customer\u2019s Azure account and granting the required access rights. Advanced security configurations (step 5) requires a Cloudneeti PowerShell agent to be installed in an Azure subscription under the same tenant where the Azure subscription is located. The Cloudneeti PowerShell agent retrieves (A) additional configuration information from the Azure Active Directory (there are no Azure APIs to retrieve this information) and pushes (B) this information as a JSON file to the Cloudneeti application. Enable Azure Security Center audit policies (Optional) includes enabling Azure Security Center audit policies (Optional) includes configuring Azure Security Center free tier in order for Zscaler CSPM to pull all security recommendations and make it available within the product. Note : Please note that it is not required to have Azure Defender enabled (ASC Standard tier). Configure OS baseline and Vulnerability Assessment Solution (Optional) inlcudes connecting VMs to OMS workspace. Also deploy partner Vulnerability Assessment Solution in Azure Security Center and installing the solution on multiple VMs allows to provide visibility into missing updates, misconfigured OS security settings, endpoint protection status, and health and threat protection. Configure Cloudneeti agent on AKS, AKS Engine and VM Based Kubernetes Clusters (Optional) inlcudes Deploying Cloudneeti agent on Azure Kubernetes Service enables compliance monitoring of Azure Kubernetes Clusters - AKS, AKS-Engine and VM hosted Kubernetes Clusters. An Azure docker agent is deployed to collect data for additional security policies. Adding Azure subscription includes adding Azure subscription information to the respective Cloud Account and waiting until the first data collection is complete. S.

Create new Azure App Registration Prerequisites The below steps are required for registering Cloudneeti application in Azure Tenant using PowerShell script. Activity Description 1. Download and review PowerShell script for creation of the service principal The PowerShell script is used to create a service principal in Azure Tenant AD: Download Link. 2. Workstation : Ensure you have the latest PowerShell version (v5 and above) Verify PowerShell version by running the following command $PSVersionTable.PSVersion on the workstation where you will run the ServicePrincipal creation script. If PowerShell version is lower than 5, then follow this link for installation of a later version: Download Link. 3. Workstation: Before executing the script, make sure there are no restrictions in running the PowerShell script Use this PowerShell command: Set-ExecutionPolicy ` -Scope Process ` -ExecutionPolicy Bypass PowerShell contains built-in execution policies that limit its use as an attack vector. By default, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the primary policy for script execution. The bypass allows for running scripts and keeps the lowered permissions isolated to just the current running process. 4. Workstation: Install Azure Modules to execute PowerShell commands within service principal automation script Install-Module ` -Name AzureAD ` -MinimumVersion 2.0.0.131 It is a roll-up module for the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets. Register Cloudneeti Application Use the Create-ServicePrincipal-AzureOnboarding.ps1 script to create and register a Cloudneeti Application. Open PowerShell in administrator mode. Go to the directory where Create-ServicePrincipal-AzureOnboarding.ps1 was downloaded earlier. Run the below command to create a service principal .\\Create-ServicePrincipal-AzureOnboarding.ps1 ` -azureActiveDirectoryId <Active_Directory_Id> ` -servicePrincipalName <data_collector_name> ` -expirationPeriod 1year The script will prompt the login screen Log in with Global AD Administrator or Application Administrator user credentials. Store service principal information from the output in a notepad. This information will be needed while onboarding the Azure account in the Cloudneeti portal. Note: In case the user doesn\u2019t want to provide the Microsoft Graph permissions given in section Azure Active Directory Permissions, you can use the disableADPolicies switch in the Create-ServicePrincipal-AzureOnboarding.ps1 command: .\\Create-ServicePrincipal-AzureOnboarding.ps1 ` -azureActiveDirectoryId <Active_Directory_Id> ` -servicePrincipalName <data_collector_name> ` -expirationPeriod 1year ` -disableADPolicies Grant admin consent for API permissions This step is optional Login to Azure Portal with Global AD Administrator role . Click on Azure Active Directory Select App registrations Select Cloudneeti Application Go to API permissions (1) Click Add a permission (2) Click on the Grant admin consent for\u2026 (3) in the Grant consent section.

Note: You will not be able to copy this value after you move away from this screen. STEP 3: Grant access to Azure subscription additional roles This step is optional Azure custom role needs to be granted to the Cloudneeti App registered in the previous step with following permission. Custom role with permission \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action\" for Azure Subscription level scope. The Cloudneeti application needs \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action\" action present in Website Contributor role in order to collect authentication and authorization configuration of Web/API/Mobile/Function Apps which is hosted on the App Service Plan. The current subscription Reader role given doesn't have sufficient permissions to collect web site configuration details. If the custom role with \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action\" is not assigned, Cloudneeti application will not be able to collect data of security policies listed here. Custom role with permission \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action\" for Azure Subscription level scope. Cloudneeti needs \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action\" action present in Storage Account Contributor role in order to collect metadata configuration of blobs. The current subscription Reader role given doesn't have sufficient permissions to list blob keys. If the custom role with \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action\" is not assigned, Cloudneeti application will not be able to collect data of security policies listed here. The following roles need to be granted to the Cloudneeti App registered in the previous step. Please follow link for steps. STEP 4: Grant access to key vaults This step is optional. The Cloudneeti application requires special permission on desired key vaults to get policy data related to secrets. If the Key Vault access policy is not added, Cloudneeti application will not be able to collect data of security policies listed here . Please follow link for steps. STEP 5: Advanced Security configurations This step is optional. An Azure Automation Account resource is deployed to collect data for additional security policies listed here . The Azure Active Directory control plane exposes the data only through PowerShell that needs to run under a Global AD reader credential. To ensure that Cloudneeti does not ever store/have access to a global AD reader, it is recommended to deploy a small PowerShell script under customer\u2019s control in their own Azure subscription. The metadata collected after running a script is then pushed to a Cloudneeti API that you registered during the Cloudneeti API key generation. Please follow link for steps. STEP 6: Enable Azure Security Center audit policies Enable pull integration with Azure Security Center free tier using either manual steps or automated scripts. Automated scripts will update configurations to enable data collection for the policies listed here . Note : Please note that it is not required to have Azure Defender enabled (ASC Standard tier). Please follow link for steps. STEP 7: Configure OS baseline and Vulnerability Assessment Solution This step is optional. Enabling Auto Provisioning of Azure Security Center monitoring agent and connect VMs to OMS workspace allows various OS baselines as defined by CIS automatically light up on the Cloudneeti dashboards. Deploy partner Vulnerability Assessment Solution in Azure Security Center and installing the solution on multiple VMs allows to provide visibility into protection status and threat protection. Please follow link for steps. STEP 8: Configure Cloudneeti agent on AKS, AKS Engine and VM based Kubernetes Clusters This step is optional. Cloudneeti includes and extends Azure Security center recommendations for AKS by deploying a Cloudneeti agent to Azure Kubernetes Cluster. A docker container agent is deployed to collect data for additional security policies. Cloudneeti then provides out-of-box mappings for all 13+ compliance frameworks included in the product. Please follow link for steps. STEP 9: Add Azure Subscription The following steps are done by Cloudneeti application License Admin role. 9.1 Activate the License Log in to the Cloudneeti application with License Admin role. Click on Activate License 9.2 Add Cloud Account Select cloud connector for Microsoft Azure Fill in the Account Name, Domain name, Azure Tenant Id (Domain ID) Azure Application ID and Azure Application Password. Click on Get Subscriptions to get the list of Azure subscriptions that Cloudneeti application can access in the selected azure tenant. If your subscription does not exist on the list then please check access to service principal Select Subscription in the dropdown menu Click Save & Continue You will receive a confirmation that the Azure subscription has been added. 9.3 Data Collection and verfication Once the Azure subscription is added to the cloud account under Cloudneeti License, it requires about 5 minutes for the data to be collected and processed, before they can be displayed in Cloudneeti dashboards. Select Dashboard on the menu Review the data on dashboard Congratulations! You have added an Azure subscription to Cloudneeti application. Verify cloud account health status for prerequisite permissions and configurations verfied on every scan. Note: Cloudneeti uses the App Registration (aka service principal) to register Cloudneeti\u2019s MPN ID (4758633) as a Partner to your Azure subscription. It usually takes about a month for Microsoft to reflect this association on the Customer's Partner Admin Link (PAL) portal page . Microsoft\u2019s PAL program makes it easier for Cloudneeti to be recognized as a cloud partner to the customer. This allows Microsoft to share information to Cloudneeti on the health of Azure Subscription (Active/Disabled) and Account Management Support (Technical/Billing) as and when requested by Customer. For more information, refer to the documentation link here Link a Partner ID to your Azure accounts . Next Steps Onboard another Microsoft Azure Subscription to the Cloudneeti application Please follow STEP 1 to STEP 8 for required prerequisites configurations.

Cloudneeti then provides out-of-box mappings for all 13+ compliance frameworks included in the product. Deploying Cloudneeti agent on Azure Kubernetes Service enables compliance monitoring of Kubernetes cluster for security policies listed here . Prerequisites Activity Description 1. Workstation : Ensure you have the latest PowerShell version (v5 and above) Verify PowerShell version by running the following command $PSVersionTable.PSVersion on the workstation where you will run the ServicePrincipal creation script. If PowerShell version is lower than 5, then follow this link for installation of a later version: Download Link. 2. Workstation: Before executing the script, make sure there are no restrictions in running the PowerShell script Use this PowerShell command: Set-ExecutionPolicy ` -Scope Process ` -ExecutionPolicy Bypass PowerShell contains built-in execution policies that limit its use as an attack vector. By default, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the primary policy for script execution. The bypass allows for running scripts and keeps the lowered permissions isolated to just the current running process. 3.

Activity Description 1. Download and review PowerShell script for creation of the service principal The PowerShell script is used to create a service principal in Azure Tenant AD: Download Link. 2. Workstation: Ensure you have the latest PowerShell version (v5 and above) Verify PowerShell version by running the following command $PSVersionTable.PSVersion on the workstation where you will run the ServicePrincipal creation script. If the PowerShell version is lower than 5, then follow this link for installation of a later version: Download Link. 3. Workstation: Before executing the script, make sure there are no restrictions in running the PowerShell script Use this PowerShell command: Set-ExecutionPolicy ` -Scope Process ` -ExecutionPolicy Bypass PowerShell contains built-in execution policies that limit its use as an attack vector. By default, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the primary policy for script execution. The bypass allows for running scripts and keeps the lowered permissions isolated to just the current running process. 4. Workstation: Install Azure Modules to execute PowerShell commands within service principal automation script Install-Module ` -Name AzureAD ` -MinimumVersion 2.0.0.131 It is a roll-up module for the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets. Register Cloudneeti Application Use the Create-ServicePrincipal-Office365Onboarding.ps1 script to create and register a Cloudneeti Application. Open PowerShell in administrator mode. Go to the directory where Create-ServicePrincipal-Office365Onboarding.ps1 was downloaded earlier. Run the below command to create a service principal .\\Create-ServicePrincipal-Office365Onboarding.ps1 ` -azureActiveDirectoryId <Active_Directory_Id> ` -servicePrincipalName <data_collector_name> ` -expirationPeriod 1year The script will prompt the login screen Log in with Global AD Administrator or Application Administrator user credentials. Store service principal information from the output in a notepad. This information will be needed while onboarding the Azure account in the Cloudneeti portal. Grant admin consent for API permissions The Azure Global AD Administrator needs to grant permissions to the Cloudneeti application to be able to collect the Azure AD data. Click Azure Active Directory Click App registrations Find and select Cloudneeti application under Display Name Go to API permissions Click Grant admin consent in the Grant consent section Review permissions as below listed (1) API Permission Name Type Microsoft.Graph Organization.Read.All Refer here Application Microsoft.Graph SecurityEvents.Read.All Refer here Application Microsoft.Graph DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All Refer here Application Microsoft.Graph DeviceManagementApps.Read.All Refer here Application Microsoft.Graph Application.Read.All Refer here Application Microsoft.Graph User.Read.All Refer here Application Click Grant admin consent in the Grant consent section (2) 1.3 Collect Information The Cloudneeti application License Admin requires this information to add an Azure subscription as a cloud account.

Note: You will not be able to copy this value after you move away from this screen. (3) STEP 2: Add Office 365 subscription The following steps are done by the Cloudneeti application License Admin role. 2.1 Activate the License Log in to the Cloudneeti application with License Admin role. Click on Activate License 2.2 Add Cloud Account Select cloud connector for Office 365 Fill in the Account Name, Domain name, Azure Tenant Id (Domain ID) Azure Application ID and Azure Application Password. Click on Add Account You receive a confirmation that Office 365 has been added and data collection started. 2.3 Data Collection Once Azure subscription is added to the cloud account under Cloudneeti License, it requires about 5 minutes for the data to be collected and processed, before they can be displayed in Cloudneeti dashboards. Select Dashboard on the menu Review the data on dashboard STEP 3: Advanced security configurations This step is optional. The following steps are done by Microsoft Azure Subscription Owner (or Subscription Contributor) role. An Azure Automation Account resource is deployed to collect data for additional security policies. The Office 365 control plane exposes the data only through PowerShell that needs to run under a Global AD administrator credential (with MFA access). To ensure that Cloudneeti does not ever store/have access to a global AD administrator, it is recommended to deploy a small PowerShell script under customer\u2019s control in their own Azure subscription. The metadata collected after running a script is then pushed to a Cloudneeti API that you registered during the Cloudneeti API key generation. 3.1 Collect Information Information Source / Portal to use User Cloudneeti License Id Cloudneeti License Admin Cloudneeti Account Id Cloudneeti License Admin Office Directory Id Cloudneeti License Admin Cloudneeti Application Id Cloudneeti License Admin Cloudneeti Environment Cloudneeti Team License Admin Cloudneeti API key Cloudneeti Team License Admin Artifacts Name Cloudneeti Team License Admin Data Collector Version Cloudneeti Team License Admin Cloudneeti M365 data collector artifacts storage access Key Cloudneeti Team License Admin Cloudneeti data collector Service Principal secret Microsoft Azure Subscription Owner Azure Subscription Id Microsoft Azure Subscription Owner Office Domain Office 365 portal Office 365 user with Exchnage Admin and SharePoint Admin role Office Admin Email Id Office 365 portal Office 365 user with Exchnage Admin and SharePoint Admin role Office 365 App Password Office 365 portal Office 365 user with Exchnage Admin and SharePoint Admin role Cloudneeti license and account details Login to Cloudneeti portal as a License Admin.

Refer documentation for more details [here](../../administratorGuide/azureASCPushIntegration/){target=_blank}. - **Override security policy status** : Cloudneeti allows admin users to override the security policy status. After an evaluation of a risk associated to policy compliance, Customers/Auditors can decide on overriding the policy to meet the internal governance needs. Various options to indicate 3rd party compensating controls, time-bound exceptions to exclude policies are available. Overriding policy status indicates that you have completed resolution and if done without caution, it might carry an inherent security risk. New resolution status will be effective at the cloud account level across all benchmarks post next successful Cloud account scan. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../administratorGuide/overrideSecurityPolicyStatus/){target=_blank}. - **Added support for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Cloudneeti includes and extends Azure Security center recommendations for AKS by deploying a Cloudneeti agent to Azure Kubernetes Cluster. A docker container agent is deployed to collect data for additional security policies. Cloudneeti then provides out-of-box mappings for all 13+ compliance frameworks included in the product. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../onboardingGuide/configureCloudneetiAgentInAKS/){target=_blank}. - **Security Policy Status:** Added new policy statuses to provide more clarity to the security posture. This helps enterprise customers, MSPs and large risk auditors to conduct continuous security assurance using the Cloudneeti product. Refer documentation for more details [here](../../gettingStarted/howItWorks/#security-posture){target=_blank}. - Manual \u2013 a security policy that is managed manually by the customer. - Prerequisite \u2013 indicates that the policy needs actions by customers, e.g. configure permissions or deploy agents to collect meta-data. - Excluded \u2013 indicates the policy was excluded as part of a policy governance actions. - Deprecated the \u201cSecurity\u201d dashboard and added navigation for dashboards (Compliance, Risk, & Assets Security) in the left navigation menu. 2. **Platform & Stability Improvements** - Fixed following bugs - \"Windows 2012R2 - Ensure 'Restore files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'\" not able to open details page. - Getting 'No resources' even if 'Storage Contributor' role is assigned and storage accounts are also present. 3. **Policies & Benchmarks Additions/Updates** Added following 73 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) related policies | **Category** | **Policy Title** | | --- | --- | | Kubernetes -

STEP 2: Configure Cloud Account for remediation Login to Cloudneeti portal with License Admin role Select desired License (1) and Cloud Account (2) Click Configure Select Configure Account Remediation Enable remediation (1) Enter the AWS account id (2) This can be same as AWS account or different account id where Cloudneeti remediation framework is deployed. Save (3) This will validate Cloudneeti Remediation framework on given AWS account and enable remediation on success. Note: In case of invalid remediation account id, missing remediation framework or roles on the provided remediation account id, Cloudneeti displays the error message. Configured email ids will receive an email with details and steps for fixing the issues, once fixed please repeat above steps to enable* Cloud Account Remediation . STEP 3: Configure policy remediation Login to Cloudneeti portal with License Admin role Select desired License (1) and Cloud Account (2) Navigate to Configurations (3) and Security Policies (4) Select Account Level (5) Select Remediation available in filter (6) Enable policies for remediation (7) Click Save (8) Confirm by hitting \u201cYes Please\u201d on confirmation message box. STEP 4: Remediate non-compliant resources Cloudneeti supports two ways to remediate non-compliant resources. Manually Triggered [for existing resources] - To remediate all the existing non-compliant resources, follow below procedure. Auto Remediation [for new resources] - Cloudneeti remediation framework has in-built capability to automatically remediate the non-compliant resources. Once the remediation policies are enabled in Cloudneeti, the new resources get automatically remediated in near real time. Manually Triggered [for existing resources] Login to Cloudneeti portal with License Admin role Select desired License (1) and Cloud Account (2) Click Cloud Security Best Practices (3) Click Remediate (4) All remediation enabled policies will appear. If the selection checkbox is disable state please check all prerequisites are met. Select desired policy/policies (1) Click Remediate Now (2) Remediation will change the configuration for resources to make them compliant with the policy with deploy if not exist. STEP 5: Verify Resource Remediation On remediation of non-compliant resources using manually triggered or auto-remediation will not show the updated resource configuration in Cloudneeti immediately. Verification of latest resource configurations can be done after next scan in the Cloudneeti portal. To get the latest configuration perform an on-demand re-scan the in Cloudneeti portal using below steps, Login to Cloudneeti portal with License Admin role Select desired License (1) and Cloud Account (2) Click Configure (3) Select re-scan (4) It will take a few minutes to scan and process data. On Dashboards Last Scanned On will be updated once data scan and processing done. Verify data on Dashboard Upgrade of Remediation framework Cloudneeti periodically releases new sets of remediation policies to the customer. To use the latest remediation policies, customer needs to upgrade their AWS remediation framework. Cloudneeti will notify customers whenever new version of remediation framework gets release. To upgrade the remediation framework, you need to use the deployment commands as it is with the same input parameters. Cloudneeti Remediation Framework Local Account Remediation The remediation framework uses CloudTrail, CloudWatch event rules, the remediation lambda functions, Invoker lambda function in multiple regions, and the appropriate IAM roles. AWS account administrator creates/updates/reconfigure resources in aws account CloudTrail and CloudWatch event bus collects the events occurred in AWS account and trigger appropriate event rule CloudWatch event rule trigger the auto-remediation invoker in near real-time in its region From different aws region Auto-remediation-invoker lambda calls the orchestrator which then call appropriate remediation functions present in the remediation framework Remediation functions setup required security configuration on the resources Multi Account Remediation Annexure Policies enabled for auto-remediation Remediation lambda functions are assigned with permissions listed as per policies for related AWS services.

Activity Description 1. Download and review PowerShell script to harden operating system baseline configuration The PowerShell script is used to harden operating system baseline configuration: Azure - Windows Server 2016 VM baseline policies for CSBP Azure - Windows Server 2016 VM baseline policies for CIS Benchmark Windows Server 2016 Version 1.0.0 2. Virtual Machine : Ensure you have the latest PowerShell version (v5 and above) Verify PowerShell version by running the following command $PSVersionTable.PSVersion on the Virtual Machine where you will run the script to harden operating system baseline configuration. If PowerShell version is lower than 5, then follow this link for installation of a later version: Download Link. 3. Virtual Machine: Before executing the script, make sure there are no restrictions in running the PowerShell script Use this PowerShell command: Set-ExecutionPolicy ` -Scope Process ` -ExecutionPolicy Bypass PowerShell contains built-in execution policies that limit its use as an attack vector. By default, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the primary policy for script execution. The bypass allows for running scripts and keeps the lowered permissions isolated to just the current running process. 4.

If PowerShell version is lower than 5, then follow this link for installation of a later version: Download Link. 3. Virtual Machine: Before executing the script, make sure there are no restrictions in running the PowerShell script Use this PowerShell command: Set-ExecutionPolicy ` -Scope Process ` -ExecutionPolicy Bypass PowerShell contains built-in execution policies that limit its use as an attack vector. By default, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the primary policy for script execution. The bypass allows for running scripts and keeps the lowered permissions isolated to just the current running process. 4.

Activity Description 1. Download and review PowerShell script to harden operating system baseline configuration The PowerShell script is used to harden operating system baseline configuration: Azure - Windows Server 2016 VM baseline policies for CSBP Azure - Windows Server 2016 VM baseline policies for CIS Benchmark Windows Server 2016 Version 1.0.0 2. Virtual Machine : Ensure you have the latest PowerShell version (v5 and above) Verify PowerShell version by running the following command $PSVersionTable.PSVersion on the Virtual Machine where you will run the script to harden operating system baseline configuration. If PowerShell version is lower than 5, then follow this link for installation of a later version: Download Link. 3. Virtual Machine: Before executing the script, make sure there are no restrictions in running the PowerShell script Use this PowerShell command: Set-ExecutionPolicy ` -Scope Process ` -ExecutionPolicy Bypass PowerShell contains built-in execution policies that limit its use as an attack vector. By default, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the primary policy for script execution. The bypass allows for running scripts and keeps the lowered permissions isolated to just the current running process. 4.
